4-Channel Home Automation with ESP32 PCB This project is a 4-channel home automation system based on the ESP32, designed to control electrical appliances via Wi-Fi, MQTT, or a mobile app. The custom PCB integrates relays, optoisolated inputs, and an efficient power supply for reliable operation.

Features

 `ESP32-based Wi-Fi control (supports web server & MQTT).

` 4-Channel relay output for appliance control.

 `Optoisolated inputs for safe external switch connections.

 `Onboard buck converter (AC/DC to 5V) for efficient power.

 `Compact PCB design for easy enclosure integration
